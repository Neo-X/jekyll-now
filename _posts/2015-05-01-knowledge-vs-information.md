I have spent a far bit of time in the education system and I feel there is a great difference between <i>knowledge</i> and <i>information</i>. The internet is full of information, tons of small <i>independent pieces of data</i>. When you are at school you spend most of your time learning <i>rules</i> that you can reuse. <i>Learning</i> becomes the process of gluing your information together using the knowledge you have. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0lxtGQzgjq0/VUP4SCG4CMI/AAAAAAAABR0/ill1awXb6cg/s1600/Knowledge_data.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="255" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0lxtGQzgjq0/VUP4SCG4CMI/AAAAAAAABR0/ill1awXb6cg/s1600/Knowledge_data.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />As a graduate student I feel that I create so much information and I never have enough time to study it.
